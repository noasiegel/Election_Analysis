# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of the election audit analysis was to help Tom, a Colorado board of elections employee, with analyzing the results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. I was tasked with reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. By using Python through VS code and Terminal, I was able to create a succinct, easy-to-read output that highlighted the aforementioned information.
